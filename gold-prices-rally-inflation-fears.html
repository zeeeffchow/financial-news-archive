    <h1>Gold Prices Rally as Inflation Concerns Resurface</h1>
    <p><em>December 12, 2024 | Commodities Market Report</em></p>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>
            Gold futures climbed 2.1% to $2,085 per ounce as investors sought safe-haven
            assets amid renewed inflation concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
            The precious metal benefited from a weaker dollar and growing expectations
            that the Federal Reserve may need to maintain higher interest rates for longer.
