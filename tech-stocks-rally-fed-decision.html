    <div class="article-content">
        <p>
            Major technology stocks surged Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's announcement
            that it would pause interest rate hikes for the remainder of the quarter, citing
            improved inflation metrics and stabilizing economic indicators.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apple Inc. (AAPL) led the rally, climbing 3.2% to close at $195.45, while Microsoft
            Corporation (MSFT) gained 2.8% to reach $378.90. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite
            Index jumped 1.9%, its strongest single-day performance in three weeks.
        </p>

        <div class="stock-ticker">
            <strong>Market Movers:</strong><br>
            • AAPL: +3.2% ($195.45)<br>
            • MSFT: +2.8% ($378.90)<br>
            • GOOGL: +2.1% ($142.30)<br>
            • NVDA: +4.5% ($495.20)
        </div>

        <p>
            "This decision reflects the Fed's confidence that inflation is moving toward our
            2% target," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during the press conference.
            "We believe the economy is in a good position to weather current challenges without
            additional monetary tightening."
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            The pause in rate hikes removes a significant headwind for growth stocks,
            particularly in the technology sector where higher borrowing costs have pressured
            valuations throughout 2024.
        </div>

        <p>
            Investment analysts view the Fed's decision as a positive signal for equity markets
            heading into the final weeks of the year. Goldman Sachs raised its year-end S&P 500
            target to 4,800, citing improved sentiment and strong corporate earnings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Treasury yields fell sharply on the news, with the 10-year note dropping 12 basis
            points to 4.18%. The dollar weakened against major currencies as rate differential
            expectations narrowed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking ahead, market participants will focus on upcoming inflation data and the
            Fed's December meeting minutes for further guidance on monetary policy trajectory
            in early 2025.
